# Exercise 1 - Design Patterns Implementation

Six design patterns implemented in separate Java files with proper package structure.

## Patterns Demonstrated:

### Behavioral Patterns:
1. **Observer** - Task notification system to multiple developers
2. **Strategy** - Interchangeable payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal)

### Creational Patterns:
3. **Singleton** - Configuration manager with single instance
4. **Factory** - Document creation (Word, PDF, Spreadsheet)

### Structural Patterns:
5. **Adapter** - Legacy printer integration with modern interface
6. **Decorator** - Coffee ordering system with dynamic add-ons

## How to Run:

```bash
# Compile all files
javac Main.java

# Run the demonstration
java Main



Exercise 2 - Astronaut Schedule Organizer
Features:
Add/Remove/View tasks with time validation

Priority levels (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

Conflict detection for overlapping tasks

Task completion tracking

Design Patterns:
Singleton - ScheduleManager

Factory - TaskFactory

Observer - Notifications

Custom Exceptions - InvalidTimeException

How to Run:
bash
cd exercise2/src
javac Main.java
java Main
